        </ul>

<h2><b> Usage </b></h2>
        Before running the app place <b>Resources<b> folder in the Bin folder, or anywhere where the executable is creted, after that just run the application.


<b><h2>Compile</h2></b>
<h3>Linux</h3>
        On Linux, you can use `make` to build the project. This will place everything in the `Bin` folder.

<h3>Windows</h3>
        On Windows, you have two options to build the project::

1. **Manual Build**
           - Build the project manually using `g++`.
           - Place the required files (SDL2 .dll files and the **Resources** folder containing assets) in the appropriate directories.

2. **Automated Build (using `build.bat`)**
           - Use my script build.bat, which uses MinGW to build the project and automates most tasks.
           - **Requirements**: You need to have `SDL2/include` and `SDL2/lib` directories in a folder named **Dependencies** on your local `C:` drive. You can also modify the `DEFAULT_INCLUDE` and `DEFAULT_LIB` to point to a different folder if your SDL2 files are located elsewhere.
           - This script also embeds descriptions, version information, and a game icon into the executable (`PixelDynasty.exe`), making it ready to be shipped.

In the end, you should have a Bin folder containing the Resources folder along with all the necessary .dll files.
