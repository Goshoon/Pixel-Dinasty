<h1><b>Pixel Dinasty - Sandbox </b></h1>
        Small sandbox game made using C++ and SDL2, based in games lie "Powder" and "The Sandbox".

            <li> Use materials such as Water with basic fluid mechanics or dirt </li>
            <li> Swap colors for dynamic and static pixels </li>

        </ul>

<h2><b> Usage </b></h2>
        Before running the app place <b>Resources<b> folder in the Bin folder, or anywhere where the executable is creted, after that just run the application.


<h2>**Compile<**/h2>
        On <b>linux<b> you can use make to build the project it should place everything on the Bin folder. 
        On <b>Windowsb</b> you have two options:

1. **Manual Build**
   - Build the project manually using `g++`.
   - Place the required files (SDL2 .dll files and the **Resources** folder containing assets) in the appropriate directories.

2. **Automated Build (using `build.bat`)**
   - Use my script, `build.bat`, which uses MinGW to build the project and automates most tasks.
   - **Requirements**: You need to have SDL2's `include` and `lib` directories in a folder named **Dependencies** on your local `C:` drive. You can also modify the `build.bat` file to point to a different folder if your SDL2 files are located elsewhere.
   - This script also embeds descriptions, version information, and a game icon into the executable (`PixelDynasty.exe`), making it ready to be shipped.
In the end, you should have a Bin folder containing the Resources folder along with all the necessary .dll files.
